## Important Features

The GroceryList Manager is loaded with powerful ready to use features: 

### Device Database 

The GLM comes equipped with a modest, yet powerful client-side database that will allow you to update the grocery items that are not pre-loaded into the database. This feature is important, as we know that certain grocery items may be more niche and unique based on a variety of factors. For instance; a new flavor of Ben & Jerry's has just been released and you have to try it. You, the user will have the power to add that new flavor into your database, which is categorized by grocery types. Your new favorite Ben and Jerry flavor will not be forgotten in the freezer section any more! Our team of highly capable software engineers were able to implement this feature utilizing the Android Software Development Kit to ensure that there was no compatability errors. This in essence means that you will always be able to add any item of your choice (to include its type). Our team has worked tirelessly to ensure that we covered all the basis, but as smart as we are can not predict the future. Once you have added that new flavor of ice cream to the database, it will not need to be added again. Just simply add an item to your list as you would regularly do, and the GLM will add that delicious flavor of ice cream to the regular item list page.
